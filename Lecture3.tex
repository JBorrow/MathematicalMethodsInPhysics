\section{Linear operators}
An operator is an object that associates one vector space with another:
$$
	\bm{y} = A \bm{x}
$$
An operator is said to be linear if:
\begin{itemize}
	\item $A(\bm{a} + \bm{b}) = A\bm{a} + b\bm{b}$
	\item $A(\lambda\bm{a}) = \lambda (A\bm{a})$
\end{itemize}
We can write operators as matricies.

\section{Matricies}
A matrix is an array of elements written by enclosing them in parentheses. A
vector is also a matrix, with only one column or row. By convention we write
$\bm{x}$ as a column vector.

\subsection{Matrix addition}
For some element $A_{ij}$:
$$
	S = A + B \; \rightarrow \; S_{ij} = A_{ij} + B_{ij}
$$

\subsection{Multiplication by scalar}
$$
	S = \lambda A \; \rightarrow \; S_{ij} = \lambda A_{ij}
$$

\subsection{Matrix multiplication}
$$
	P = AB \; \rightarrow \; P_{ij} = \Sigma_n A_{in}B_{nj}
$$
Where the matrices have dimensions $(x \times n)$ and $(n \times y)$ for
matricies $A$ and $B$ respectively.

Matrix multiplication is \emph{not} commutitive - i.e.:
$$
	AB \neq BA
$$

\subsection{Transpose}
If a matrix is transposed, it returns the columns and rows switched:
$$
	A_{ij}^{T} = A_{ji}
$$
\subsubsection{The Hermition conjugate}
This is the same as transpose, but also takes the complex conjugate:
$$
	A_{ij}^{\dagger} = A^*_{ji}
$$

\subsection{Trace}
The trace of a matrix is the sum of the diagonal elements:
$$
	Tr(A) = \Sigma_n A_{nn}
$$
The trace of a multiple product of matricies is invariant under a cyclic
permutation of matricies:
$$
	Tr(ABC) = Tr(ACB) = Tr(BCA) = \hdots
$$
