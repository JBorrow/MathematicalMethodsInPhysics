\section{Linearly independent vectors}

Given a set of $m$ vectors, $\bm{a}_1$, $\bm{a}_2$, ...,$\bm{a}_3$, a linear
combination of these vectors is an expression:
$$
	c_1\bm{a}_1 + c_2\bm{a}_2 + ... + c_m\bm{a}_m
$$
Where $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_m$ are scalars.

\paragraph{Defintion: Linearly independent} vectors satisfy the equation:
$$
	c_1\bm{a}_1 + c_2\bm{a}_2 + ... + c_m\bm{a}_m = \bm{0}
$$
if and only if $c_1$, $c_2$, ..., $c_m = 0$.
	
If the above equation holds when the scalars are not 0, we say that the set of
vectors are \emph{linearly dependent}. If they are linearly dependent, this
means that at least one of them is a scalar multiple of the others.
\begin{proof} 
If $c_1 \neq 0$:
$$
	\bm{a}_1 = \frac{1}{c_1}(c_2\bm{a}_2 + ... + c_m\bm{a}_m)
$$
\end{proof}

\section{Linear vector space}

A set of $V$ elements $\bm{a}$, $\bm{b}$, ..., is called a linear vector space
$V$. It's elements are all vectors if there are two operations called
\emph{addition} and \emph{scalar multiplication}, and satisfy the following
criteria:

\begin{itemize}
	\item $\bm{a} + \bm{b} \in V$ for all $\bm{a}, \bm{b} \in V$ (closed under
	addition)
	\item $\lambda\bm{a} \in V$ for all $\lambda \in \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{C}$ and
	$\bm{a} \in V$ (closed under scalar multiplication)
	\item $\bm{a} + \bm{b} = \bm{b} + \bm{a}$ for all $\bm{a}, \bm{b} \in V$ 
	(commuitive)
	\item $(\bm{a} + \bm{b}) + \bm{c} = \bm{a} + (\bm{b} + \bm{c})$ for all 
	$\bm{a}, \bm{b}, \bm{c} \in V$ (associative)
	\item $(\mu + \lambda)\bm{a} = \mu\bm{a} + \lambda\bm{a}$ for all $\bm{a}
	\in V$ and $\mu, \lambda \in \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{C}$ (distributitive)
	\item There exists a $\bm{0} \in V$ such that $\bm{0} + \bm{a} = \bm{a}$ for
	all $\bm{a} \in V$
	\item For all $\bm{a} in V$ there exists $-\bm{a}$ such that $\bm{a} + (-
	\bm{a}) = \bm{0}$
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Dimension}
The maximum number of linearly independent vectors in $V$ is called the
dimension of $V$ (dim$V$).

\section{Basis}
A basis is a set of linearly independent vectors that can be taken in scalar
multiples to span the whole of the vector space (you can make any vector in the
space with this set). The requirements are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The vectors are linearly independent
	\item dim(Basis) = dim($V$)
\end{itemize}
One example of this is the \emph{standard basis} of $\mathbb{R}^3$:
$$
	\hat{i} = \begin{pmatrix}1\\0\\0\end{pmatrix}
	\hat{j} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\1\\0\end{pmatrix}
	\hat{k} = \begin{pmatrix}0\\0\\1\end{pmatrix}
$$
